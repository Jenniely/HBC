                <p class="about__text section-text">We exist to reach and unite local Bikers and like-minded souls for Christ, to be a family of believers who meet regularly for a time of teaching and preaching of God’s word, along with time for corporate prayer and praise. We further exist to work together in various outreach ministries, from helping our fellow bikers in need to ministering to those in prison.
                </p>
                <p class="about__text section-text">Our members are everything from hardcore bikers to accountants and lawyers. Some are members of local MCs, RCs, or MMs, but most are independent. Most ride Harley touring bikes, but any bike is welcome. You may even cage it and bring your children. 

                </p>
                <p class="about__text section-text">Expect to be greeted with smiles and hugs, and to be treated like family. 
                </p>
                <p class="about__text section-text">Our services tend to be heavy on the music, interspersed with a meeting and bible study time, and then with a short sermon. The teaching and preaching are kept relatively simple and are strictly bible-based. We may be non-judgmental, but we are not “soft on sin” in what we teach and preach.
                </p>
                <p class="about__text section-text">We call ourselves “Interdenominational” to indicate that while we are independent, we are not against denominations, and our teaching is compatible with most conservative, bible-believing churches. On the non-essential points of doctrine that separate some churches, we choose to not take a position that would divide.
                </p>

                <p class="about__text section-text">Houston Biker Church is fully independent, and is affiliated with Church Project.</p>

                <p class="believe__text section-text"><span class="believe__text_accent">We believe</span> that God is the source of all love and good, and all things good come from God. The world is beautiful, and the world is broken. God created all things good, but we corrupted this creation. God loves us, and by His grace, delights and desires to rescue us and to restore us in our relationship with Him. God stepped into our broken world to give forgiveness and life to all who trust in His salvation, Christ as our Savior. Jesus died on the cross as a perfect substitute for our penalty of sin, and resurrected to overcome death caused by sin. Through faith in Jesus Christ – not being good enough or doing enough good – we are restored to a right relationship with God.
                </p>
                <p class="believe__text section-text"><span class="believe__text_accent">We believe</span> there is only one God, the uncreated Creator, who exists eternally as a Trinity of three persons: Father, Son, and Spirit. Each member of the Trinity is fully and equally God, yet personally distinct from one another.</p>
                <p class="believe__text section-text"><span class="believe__text_accent">We believe</span> that God in the flesh, Jesus Christ, lived a sinless life, was crucified and died on the cross, was resurrected from the dead, and ascended to Heaven.</p>
                <p class="believe__text section-text"><span class="believe__text_accent">We believe</span> the Holy Spirit of God comes to live within a person once they trust in Christ as their Savior. The Holy Spirit indwells all believers to live a powerful Christ-like life, to build an intimate relationship with God, to secure salvation, and to give gifts that build the church and spread the Gospel.
                </p>
                <p class="believe__text section-text"><span class="believe__text_accent">We believe</span> God created men and women to live in relationship with Him, but the first humans chose to rebel against God and brought sin into the world. Sin spread like a virus to all humans, and all have sinned, and our sin has separated us all from God.
                </p>
                <p class="believe__text section-text"><span class="believe__text_accent">We believe</span> that the Bible is God’s Word to us, written by men who were inspired by God. God wrote His Scriptures to reveal Himself to mankind, and to direct us in His best way to live life.
                </p>
                <p class="believe__text section-text"><span class="believe__text_accent">We believe</span> the church is God’s powerful plan for His people. Living in community as a diverse family, loving and serving and helping one another grow in our faith, we reveal God’s plan for restoring goodness into our world.

This is right off of I-45, just north of Hwy 99, and is thus easily accessible to most parts of town.

                    <p class="meetings__text section-text">On Wednesday evening HBC meets in smaller groups in different houses around town. These house church meetings are essentially the equivalent of “Sunday School” classes in other churches, focused on Bible Study and fellowship.
                    </p>
                    <p class="meetings__text section-text">This schedule allows for our members to go to various bike rallies and events on weekends, and still be fully involved in a local church of like-minded believers.
